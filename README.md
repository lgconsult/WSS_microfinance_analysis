# WSS_microfinance_analysis
This project analyzes the effectiveness of a microfinance program for water supply and sanitation loans using survey data in R studio. The code written was used to determine if those who received microloans were more likely to have improved water or sanitation infrastructure by the end of the surveying period. Results are not able to be shared because the report and data are not publicly available.
